# eightballproject
The Eight Ball Project was an extra activity I took on during one of the first modules of my MIT xPRO Fullstack programming coding bootcamp.
I learned how to create shapes on a webpage and advanced those skills to create shapes with different colors, dimensions, and at different z positions.
